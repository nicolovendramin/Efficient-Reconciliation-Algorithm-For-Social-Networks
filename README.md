IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PAPER : An efficient reconciliation algorithm for social networks
by Nitish Korula and Silvio Lattanzi.

The project is realized by Joan Ficapal Vila and Nicol√≤ Vendramin in the context of the course "Advanced Algorithms
and Parallel Programming" (A.A. 2016/2017), under the supervision of Prof. Ferrandi and Prof Lattuada.

The folder named "code" contains the implementation.
The folder named "documentation" contains a set of slide decks that are made to explain in detail the project and to
document the development.
The folder named "informative_materials" contains other materials from which we have extracted some informations in
addition to a copy of the above mentioned paper explaining the algorithm.

All the code belonging to this code base is released under a public license and can be used by everyone.

In case of need it is possible to contact the developers using one of the two following e-mail adresses:
